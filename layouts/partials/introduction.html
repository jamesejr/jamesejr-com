I'm a Security Engineer @ <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>, currently working on Detection Engineering & Incident Response.<br>
I really enjoy <u>investigating</u> compromises, <u>researching</u> and <u>analyzing</u> targeted attacks, and trying to understand who we're up against
to get ahead from a <b>detection</b>, <b>prevention</b>, and <b>response</b> perspective.<br><br>
Made in Chicago ♥️. Based out of San Francisco.
