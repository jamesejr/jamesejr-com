I'm a Security Engineer @ <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>, currently working on Detection Engineering & Incident Response.<br><br>I really enjoy investigating compromises, researching and analyzing targeted attacks, and trying to understand who we're up against to get ahead from a <b>detection</b>, <b>prevention</b>, and <b>response</b> perspective.<br><br>
