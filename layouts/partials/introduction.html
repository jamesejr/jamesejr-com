I'm a Security Engineer @ <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a>, currently working on Detection Engineering & Response Automation.<br><br>I really enjoy investigating compromises, researching and analyzing targeted attacks, and trying to understand who we're up against to get ahead from a <b>detection</b>, <b>prevention</b>, and <b>response</b> perspective.<br><br>
