It's been about five years since my last update on this blog. I've been wanting to write for a while again, but life always seems to happen. Then time escapes. A lot has changed over the past five years (personally and professionally), and I'm really excited to finally post something here for someone to read (even if it's just me).

> **tl;dr** - I'm back and look forward to writing again

I'm not entirely sure what I will post in here just yet, but I hope most of it will be related to information security, technology, and knowledge or experiences that I come across and feel is interesting enough to write about.

It's possible most of the content may not even be useful to the world, but it will serve as a central (and public) location for me to dump some thoughts and ideas. I'll keep this one short, but I hope to share some exciting news very soon!
