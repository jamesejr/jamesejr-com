  <p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to get into the habit of writing more - especially at the end of every year when I can reflect on all my wins and losses. There&rsquo;s no doubt 2020 was quite an eventful year for everyone. Thankfully, despite it all, I was able to make the best of it. Here are some of my highlights of 2020.</p>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<p>During the first half of the year, my partner and I drove up north to taste wine in Healdsburg and Napa Valley. Being surrounded by vinyards and calmness was quite something that I really enjoyed.</p>

<p>We also drove down the scenic Highway 1 from San Francisco to Big Sur. I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of the traffic, but the drive was breathtaking.</p>

<p>Lastly, one of my most memorable experiences last year was to drive down to Southern California to visit San Diego, <a href="https://www.temeculawines.org/taste/winery-listing.php">Temecula Valley Wine Country</a> (for more wine!), and Joshua Tree. Staying in the middle of a desert during the hottest time of the year (August) was crazy, but well worth it!</p>
<p>Our favorite wine tasting experience in SoCal was by far <a href="https://www.europavillage.com/">Europa Village</a>.</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite parks in San Francisco. It also happens to be a block away from where I live. It&rsquo;s probably the only park I visited the most in 2020. It&rsquo;s the park where I went on morning walks to and one of the few places where I felt the most relaxed.</p>
<figure>

<p>This is the same park during the 2020 fire season in California, which was reportedly the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-fires-damage-climate-change-analysis/">worst ever</a>.</p>
<p>This also happened to be the first time I ever experienced something like this. Wild fires was not something I ever really worried about in Chicago, but it made me realize how fortunate we are to generally have access to clean air. Not everyone has this privilege.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also thankful for all the first responders and people who helped respond to these incidents - especially during a pandemic.</p>

<p>If I had to summarize my highlights of 2020, I&rsquo;d say most of it was exploring California (safely), hiking, and drinking wine (a lot of it).</p>
<p>I learned how much I really appreciate nature, disconnecting from the world, finding peace, and trying to be relaxed. My anxiety and stress levels have gone up significantly, but I&rsquo;m trying to cope with it with the little things. Everything from putting my phone on &ldquo;do not disturb&rdquo; so I can be in the moment, to trying to let go of things that don&rsquo;t really matter much (I&rsquo;m still working on this).</p>
<p>All in all, it was quite the year and one I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll all remember for many years to come. Be safe. Be healthy. Be hopeful ♥️.</p>
<h3 id="whats-next-in-2021">What&rsquo;s Next in 2021?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure what to expect, but I&rsquo;m hopeful it will be better than last year. At a high level, there are a few things I want to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read more - at least 12 books</li>
<li>Take care of myself - eat better, exercise more, worry less</li>
<li>Focus on people - build and maintain relationships, including my family</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect things will go back to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; in 2021, but like 2020, I want to continue to explore California safely with my partner. I also hope we can visit our family and friends in Chicago. I miss Chicago.</p>
